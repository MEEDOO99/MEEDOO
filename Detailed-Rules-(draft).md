# **Section A - Staff Powers**
### A1. Exclusive Privilege
Staff (those with the 'Staff' role on the server) are the only users who may enforce the rules. Users who do not have the 'staff' role are discouraged from trying to moderate other users.

### A2. Final Verdict
If a staff member makes a verdict about a situation, it is final. It is no longer up for debate and users should drop the subject. If a user is not satisfied with the Moderators' verdict, they may approach a higher staff member in private messages.

### A3. Catch-all 
The moderation team reserves the right to block problematic users from joining the server. It is not possible for me, or anyone, to list every single situation where a user might cause problems. 

# **Section B - General Server Rules**
These rules apply to all chat channels as well as nicknames.

### B1. Personal Attacks
Users should be polite and respectful when interacting with one another. Attacking other users, both on the server and in DM, is prohibited.

### B2. Use of slurs/derogatory terms
The use of slurs is prohibited, regardless of context. A slur is any term meant to demean or cause offense to a certain group, based on gender, race, sexuality, etc. 

### B3. Spam & spam content
Flooding a channel with messages (called 'spam') is prohibited. Content such as gift card giveaways, links to scams, and links to viruses or malware are also considered spam and will be removed.

### B4. Posting in the correct channel
Each channel functions like a 'category' on traditional internet forums. Only things related to the main topic of that channel can be posted there.       
**B4-1.** A channel's topic can be found next to its' name, pictured below. The description can be clicked on to reveal the full text.

### B5. Posting explicit content
Any discussions that are dark, crude, or explicit in nature (but do not involve posting pornography) must be posted in the "#off-topic" channel. Any pornography or 18+ content can _only_ be posted in the "#adult" channel. Content that is graphic or disturbing (such as gore) is prohibited altogether.

### B6. Discord Terms of Service
Any content that violates the Discord Terms of Service (https://discordapp.com/terms) is prohibited. 

### B7. Advertising
Advertising one's website, discord server, or other service is prohibited. Sending someone a link to a server is only permissible if the user requested the link beforehand.
