# **English Server**

Detailed version of the rules.

### **Section A- Staff Powers**
1. Staff and only staff may enforce the rules.
Anyone with the 'Staff' role is allowed to enforce the rules and moderate users if they do not comply. Those who do not have the 'Staff' role may not enforce the rules- they should notify a member of Staff via the #report-users channel and wait. 

2. Staff have the final say.
A staff member's verdict on a situation is final. Only a higher member of staff may change this verdict. 

3. All staff are subject to the rules.
Staff must obey the rules as well.

1. Correct channel usage.
a. Any overtly explicit discussion (including topics such as sex) must go in either the #off-topic channel or the #adult channel.

b. Pornographic content can **only** be posted in the #adult channel and nowhere else.

c. Anything posted in a channel must be relevant to its' purpose, which can be found in the channel description. 

`For example, the #english-questions channel is only for asking questions regarding the English language, and nothing else.`

2. Derogatory & explicit language.
