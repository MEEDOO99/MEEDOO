# **English Server**

Detailed version of the rules.

### **Section A - Staff Powers**
A1. Staff (those with the 'Staff' role on the server) are the only users who may enforce the rules.

A2. If a staff member makes a verdict about a situation, it is final. It is no longer up for debate and users should drop the subject. If a user is not satisfied with the Moderators' verdict, they may approach a higher staff member in private messages.

A3. The moderation team reserves the right to block problematic users from joining the server.

### **Section B - General Server Rules**
These rules apply to all chat channels as well as nicknames.

B1. Users should be polite and respectful when interacting with one another. Attacking other users, both on the server and in DM, is prohibited.

B2. The use of slurs is prohibited, regardless of context. A slur is any term meant to demean or cause offense to a certain group, based on gender, race, sexuality, etc. 

B3. Rapidly flooding a channel with messages (called 'spam') is prohibited. 

B4. To keep things organized, each channel has a specific purpose, which can be found through the channel description. Repeatedly using the wrong channel to start off-topic conversations is prohibited.

B4-1. Any mildly explicit conversations (involving topics such as sex) should be brought to the "#off-topic" channel.
B4-2. All pornographic content can **only** be posted in #adult, nowhere else.
