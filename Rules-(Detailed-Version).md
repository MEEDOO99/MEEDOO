If you see anyone breaking the rules, file a report using the following format:

`@Staff
- Include below exactly who is breaking the rules (please include usernames) and what they're doing that's against the rules
- Also include any relevant information that you think would be useful to us.`

If staff are taking a long time to reply, consider blocking the user (right click on their username > block). This will hide their messages from you and prevent them from mentioning/messaging you further.
