## 1. Listen to the Moderators. 
If they tell you to drop a subject or stop doing something- you are expected to comply. Even if what you are doing is not explicitly against the rules, it could still be disruptive to other users. Moderators have the final say in terms of your punishment. 

## 2. No spam.
We see spam as anything that clogs up the chat, including:
*  Random links posted with no context 
*  Advertisements
*  Gibberish
*  Repeated messages

## 3. No disruptive behavior.
This is primarily an English learning server. If you're acting in a way that's disruptive, hostile, or disorderly, we will take action.

## 4. Be respectful.
Be polite. Behave as you would in any social setting. Avoid using ethnic slurs or talking about certain groups in a derogatory way. 

## 5. Do not spread misinformation or mislead others about concepts regarding the english language.
Giving incorrect or misleading answers in #learning may lead to you losing access to the channel. We strictly prohibit anyone who's spreading false information in an attempt to mess others up. Additionally, don't pose as a native. It makes you less trustworthy and is painfully obvious to any of the natives around you. 

## Some additional guidelines we encourage include:
- **Post in the correct channel.** Each text channel has a purpose and we require everyone to follow this purpose for organization purposes.
- **Avoid loud/disruptive sounds in voice.** Yelling, screaming, or playing earrape is prohibited.
- **Keep fluff in #no-rules.** If you're here to spam and mess around, that's fine- just keep it in the appropriate channels. We don't want to discourage or get in the way of those looking for genuine discussion.
