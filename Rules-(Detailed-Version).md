### 1. Listen to the Moderators.
If a Moderator tells you to drop a subject or stop doing something, you need to stop. Even if something you're doing isn't explicitly against the rules, it still may be disruptive to other users. This is not an excuse not to listen to the Moderators- you still need to listen to them. If a Moderator's actions are questionable, you can message another member of staff later, but in that moment you need to comply. 

### 2. Respect others. No disruptive/disorderly behavior.
We classify any of the following as disruptive:
- Trolling
- Harassing others
- Making racist remarks or using ethnic slurs
- Breaking the Discord Terms of Service or their Community Guidelines (i.e. posting anything illegal)

Additionally, we ask that users choose appropriate nicknames and profile pictures and that they use the most appropriate channel for discussion (i.e. using #learning for asking questions). 

### 3. No spam/advertising.
Anything that clogs up chat will get removed.

### 4. Disturbing/graphic content is not allowed. NSFW content can only be posted in #no-rules, nowhere else.
Anything that wouldn't be appropriate to look at in public will probably get removed. This includes images depicting gore or anything illegal. More mature content is allowed in #no-rules. Discussion in most channels should be kept around PG-13. 

### 5. Voice Channel Guidelines
- Only English is allowed in the voice channels. Speaking any other language for an extended period of time brings value to nobody and will get you muted.
- No loud/disruptive sounds (yelling, screaming, ear rape, micspam or playing loud audio through your microphone)
- Use pauses and let others participate in the conversation. 

### 6. Do not spread misinformation or mislead others about concepts regarding the english language
Misleading others and giving incorrect answers is not allowed. Don't act like you're knowledgeable about the language if you're not- and don't pretend to be a native when you're not. 

Don't forget- this server's about learning the English language. We don't mind joking around- just don't make it get in the way of people's learning.



***

If you see someone breaking the rules, you can summon the staff members using the following format:
```
@Staff
Include here below any important information, such as:
• What's going on (how are the rules being broken?)
• Who's breaking the rules (please include specific usernames)
• Any other additional information that you think would be useful to the members of staff.
```
By sending this message in any channel, a notification is sent to staff members on all their devices letting them know you need help. They will arrive as soon as possible. If they are taking a long time, block the rulebreaker in question (right click on their name > block). This will hide their messages and prevent them from mentioning/messaging you.
