## 1. Listen to the Moderators. 
If they tell you to drop a subject or stop doing something- you are expected to comply. Even if what you are doing is not explicitly against the rules, it could still be disruptive to other users. Moderators have the final say in terms of your punishment. 

## 2. No spam.
We see spam as anything that clogs up the chat, including:
*  Random links posted with no context 
*  Advertisements
*  Gibberish
*  Repeated messages

## 3. No disruptive behavior.
This is primarily an English learning server. If you're acting in a way that's disruptive, hostile, or disorderly, we will take action.

## 4. Be respectful.
Be polite. Behave as you would in any social setting. Avoid using ethnic slurs or talking about certain groups in a derogatory way. 

Some additional guidelines we encourage include:
- **Post in the correct channel.** Each text channel has a purpose and we require everyone to follow this purpose for organization purposes.
- **Keep fluff in #no-rules.** If you're here to spam and joke around, that's great- just keep it in the appropriate channels or we may take action.
