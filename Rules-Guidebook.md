# **Section A - Staff Provisions**

### A1. Final Verdict
If a staff member makes a verdict about a situation, it is final. It is no longer up for debate and users should drop the subject. If a user is not satisfied with the Moderators' verdict, they may approach a higher staff member in private messages.

### A2. Catch-all 
The moderation team reserves the right to block problematic users from joining the server. It is not possible for me, or anyone, to list every single situation where a user might cause problems. If we deem a user to have malicious intentions, they will be removed by the staff team.

### A3. Obstruction of Staff Duties
Users who are not involved in a staff member's activities should stay out. 

**A3-1.** Attempting to obstruct a staff member in their activities is punishable.

### A4. Right to Confidentiality
The identity of those who have reported a user must remain a secret. If they wish to reveal themselves, they can do so on their own volition.

# **Section B - General Server Rules**
These rules apply server-wide and can include but are not limited to text channels, voice channels, direct message, nicknames, playing status, etc...

### B1. Harassment of users
Users should be polite and respectful when interacting with one another. Attacking other users, both on the server and in DM, is prohibited.    


**B1-1.** This rule also encompasses hate speech, or denouncing a group based on their gender, race, sexuality, etc.  


### B2. Use of slurs/derogatory terms
The use of slurs is prohibited, regardless of context. A slur is any term meant to demean or cause offense to a certain group, based on gender, race, sexuality, etc.


`Even if there is no mal-intent, using slurs often makes people feel uncomfortable or attacked. To new users who join into a conversation where slurs are being used often, it may discourage them from staying. To prevent conflict, it is best to just stop using slurs altogether.` 

### B3. Spam & spam content
Flooding a channel with messages (called 'spam') is prohibited. Content such as gift card giveaways or links to scams are also considered 'spam' and will be removed.


**B3-1.** Any malicious content (links to IP phishing sites, viruses, malware, etc.) warrant immediate ban.

**B3-2.** 'Shitposting' or low-quality posts that are not meant to be serious belong in "#off-topic". 

### B4. Posting in the correct channel
Each channel functions like a 'category' on traditional internet forums. Only things related to the main topic of that channel can be posted there.

       
**B4-1.** A channel's topic can be found next to its' name, pictured below. The description can be clicked on to reveal the full text.

**B4-2.** Discussions involving political or controversial topics must be redirected to "#politics-and-debate".

**B4-3.** Heated debates should also be redirected to "#politics-and-debate".

### B5. Posting explicit content
Any discussions that are dark, crude, or explicit in nature (but do not involve posting pornography) must be posted in the "#off-topic" channel. Any pornographic or 18+ content can _only_ be posted in the "#adult" channel. Content that is graphic or disturbing (such as gore) is prohibited entirely.

### B6. Discord Terms of Service & Community Guidelines
Any content that violates Discord's ToS or Community Guidelines is prohibited. 

### B7. Advertising
Advertising is repeatedly posting a link to a chat group with the intent of garnering more members. Advertising is prohibited both on the server and in DMs, as it is against the Discord Terms of Service. The only time advertising in DMs is allowed is if the user receiving the message asked for the link beforehand. 

### B8. Use of English
In all of the main chat channels except the "#other-languages" text channel and the "Other Languages" voice channel, English should be the primary language used to communicate.

Speaking other languages repeatedly in other channels besides the two listed above, is prohibited.

### B9. Ban Evasion
Ban evasion is joining the server with another account to bypass a previous punishment or ban. Ban evasion is prohibited, but staff have the freedom to deal with them at their discretion.

# **Section C - Learning Channels**

### C1. Answering questions.
Giving an intentionally wrong answer to a question asked in #english-questions is prohibited. Educated guesses are allowed, but must be phrased as such. You may not definitively assert you are correct when you are making an educated guess.

### C2. Impersonating a native
Do not pretend to be a native speaker of the english language. The official server definition of a 'native speaker' can be found below:

`Native - a person who learned to speak the language of the place where he or she was born as a child rather than learning it as a foreign language`

You must have been born in a primarily English-speaking country _and_ be able to speak the language to a reasonable degree.

# **Section D - Voice channels**
Keep in mind rules from section B also apply in the voice channel.

### D1. Loud, disruptive sounds
Loud disruptive sounds in the voice channel are prohibited. This includes screaming into the microphone, earrape, playing music or other sounds through your microphone, or excessive background noise.

### D2. Abuse of the music bot
Using the bot to play earrape, high pitched ringing, or any other sounds that could cause damage to one's hearing or audio equipment is prohibited. 

### D3. Cooperation with other users while using the music bot
If a user is being uncooperative while using the music bot (for example, if they are spamming their own songs onto the queue without letting people add their own songs), this is prohibited. 

### D4. Abuse of the DJ role
If a user is using their role as a DJ to prevent other users from utilizing the music bot properly, they are liable to have their role taken away from them. (For example, if a DJ were to skip songs except those queued by him)
